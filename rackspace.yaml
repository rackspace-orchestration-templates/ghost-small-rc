  #### Getting Started

  Ghost is a new blogging platform dedicated to providing a simple, easy to use
  approach to blogging. Ghost allows you to write and publish your own blog,
  giving you the tools to make it easy and even fun to do. It's simple,
  elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making
  your blog work - and more time blogging.

  The first step with your new blog is to navigate to `/ghost/signup` where you
  will create the your user. Ghost currently only supports one user at this
  time. After filling out this info, you will be redirected to the admin panel
  where you can start customizing your blog and adding new posts. To access the
  admin panel again, navigate to `/ghost`.

  For more information on using Ghost please check out Ghost's [usage
  forums](https://ghost.org/forum/using-ghost/).

  #### Plugins

  Ghost is new and is still in heavy development. However, there are already
  some plugins and themes to help customize your experience. Checkout the Ghost
  [Marketplace](http://marketplace.ghost.org/) for links. Users coming from
  WordPress may also be interested in this [WordPress
  plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/) to help migrate data from
  WordPress to Ghost.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  Ghost was installed from the latest version available.  It has been installed to
  /var/www/ghost/.  Ghost is running on port 2368.

  [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) has been configured to serve static content
  for Ghost, as well as to forward all HTTP and HTTPS connections to Ghost.

  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance, running MySQL 5.1.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the server.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided with this deployment can be used to log in as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  This key can be used to log into all servers on this deployment.
  Additionally, passwordless authentication is configured from the Master
  server to all secondary servers.
